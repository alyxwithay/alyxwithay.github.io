-I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the lab of Dr. Patrick Schloss at the University of Michigan, Department of Microbiology and Immunology. 
-I study the microbiome's role in colonization resistance against *Clostridium difficile*. 
-I'M ALMOST DONE WITH MY PHD! This gives me great joy. Thus I'm also looking for jobs :)
-I'm interested in pursuing a career in science education and outreach with particular emphasis on advocating for women in STEM.

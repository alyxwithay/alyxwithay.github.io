## General Tips

# Procrastination

[Strategies for overcoming procrastination](http://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2013/03/25/why-you-procrastinate-and-how-to-stop-it-now/)
[Unstuck](http://www.unstuck.com/how-we-procrastinate.html)
*	This is an interesting online tool to help you identify ways to overcome any "stuck" moment you're having. It asks for your thoughts and feelings about the stuck moment and attempts to diagnose the core problem of why you are procrastinating.


# Writer's Block

[12 Tips To Overcome Writerâ€™s Block For PhD Students](http://www.nextscientist.com/writers-block-phd-students)
The points I especially liked from this article:
*	**Join a support group (or find a writing buddy)** - I'm currently writing with a buddy who is also graduating soon. It's been really helpful so far. In a couple weeks there is a support group through UM I'm trying out. 
	*	We should start a student writing/general support group that meets regularly. It could be M&I's own student support group for each other. It's purpose could be to help each other set "smart" goals and achieve them. 
*	**Begin writing about anything that comes to mind** - My writing buddy suggested this yesterday.  Just brain dump all over the page and keep writing about the topic.  Then take a step back, look at all the pieces and edit!  Writing is hard, and it's easier to edit after the fact.  That's what I've been told by many advice givers.  Plus I find that getting started writing is the hardest part ("Ahh, what do I write?!"), and if all you think you are doing is "brain dumping", there is less pressure on what you write. 
*	**Write daily** - I think practicing writing will help a lot.  I don't enjoy writing because I'm scared it will turn out shitty and I think my writing confidence could be better.  I think by practicing, even with say a blog, I'd begin to feel more comfortable with putting my ideas on paper.  
*	**Alternate 45 minutes of writing with 15 minutes of rest** - The idea of sitting and writing for 8 hours straight is very daunting.  I find it's better to think of it in small doses.  The ideal ratio of work to rest varies depending on the study.  I've heard a recent one say 52 min on, 17 min off.  I like 25 min on, 10 min off for beginners. 

## Writing a Research Article

[How to write your first Research Paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178846/pdf/yjbm_84_3_181.pdf) by Elena Kallestinova

[Righting Writing](http://www.yale.edu/handelsmanlab/resources/Righting_Writing.pdf) by Jo Handelsman
 
 
## Writing a Grant

Number one grant writing resource: [The Grant Application Writer's Workbook](http://www.grantcentral.com/workbook_nih_sf424_shortened.html) by Stephen Russel and David Morrison
*	I used this book in the grant writing course at UM, and it is THE book for learning how to write NIH grants. 
*	*They have a version of this workbook for writing a biomedical research article as well.*

Who says Amanda is the only one who writes posts. 



I'm getting really frustrated. Why does it feel like everything I am doing is not good enough. I'm getting really tired. 

I feel like the guinea pig here, like I'm taking a beating for every little thing that doesn't match up to the new way of doing things.

All I want to do is finish, and I'm trying my best while also trying to maintain my sanity. Right now that's not working.

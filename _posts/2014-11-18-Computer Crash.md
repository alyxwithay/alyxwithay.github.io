This is a friendly reminder to BACK UP YO SHIT.

# My computer crashed last Thursday :(

It was with apple over the weekend. Luckily Pat had us all install CrashPlan Pro. I was pretty worried all weekend about the status of my work data. I finally finished today recovering the files that CrashPlan had saved. It turned out that I only lost a couple weeks of stuff and nothing too major either thanks to Github as well. I'm just telling myself it could've been a lot worse. 

So in conclusion *BACK UP YOUR DATA NOW!*

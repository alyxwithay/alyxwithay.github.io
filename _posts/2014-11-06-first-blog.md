Woo look at me writing my first blog post!  

### Today's Goals
I finally updated my OSX to Yosemite from whatever ancient system I was using. I updated xcode and was able to successfully install jekyll. Today I'm also going to put the disqus comments in and read through these blog posts Pat put in here before deleting them. There's still a lot more to learn... 

### Update 6:15pm
Just added the disqus to my page. I tried to follow the directions Pat gave us using the terminal to commit and push, but I found that it didn't work until I used the actual github app to commit+sync. I'm a little scared of the terminal for github purposes. Now I'm going to read through the rest of Pat's blog posts. *One question I have is why does a single quotation mark keep popping up when I write these posts using the xcode app? I'm also a little confused about using knitr with this format... The post examples don't use the three back ticks that they talk about but rather this highlight text command...*

Today I also spent 30 minutes writing, which is more than I've done in a bit. YAY! How do you eat an elephant? ... One bite at a time.

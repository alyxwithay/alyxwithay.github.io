Woo look at me writing my first blog post!  I finally updated my OSX to Yosemite from whatever ancient system I was using. I updated xcode and was able to successfully install jekyll. Today I'm also going to put the disqus comments in and read through these blog posts Pat put in here before deleting them. There's still a lot more to learn...

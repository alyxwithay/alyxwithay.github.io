Updates on Results Section for Day 0 Colonization Paper. 

# Results Section
Github repository for this paper is found [here](https://github.com/SchlossLab/abxD01).

In particular, the R markdown file named "abxD01_analysis.Rmd" (or the pdf version) contains updates on all figures, how they were generated, and what is left to do for each figure. 

1. Figure tweaking, see r markdown file listed above for specific "tweaks" left.
2. Table tweaking
3. Write results of modeling section
4. Figure to encapsulate modeling results

# Remainder of Paper

1. Introduction - 25% draft, 75% outline
2. Discussion - 100% outline
3. Materials & Methods - Add section on modeling techniques
4. Using EndNote to make the references - going to need a refresher as well as make a new library with all my papers

# R Markdown/Github repository for paper

This is largely in tact.  The structure is all there and set up for each figure. I am making updates and committing them as I work on the paper.

OMG I'm implementing Pat's suggestions. 

After losing a tidbit of work with the recent computer crash, I'm definitely coming around to Github. 

Today I made a repository called "Personal Scripts" which contains all of the scripts I've written during my time in the lab. It contains scripts for anyone in the lab to use.  Some of them were for parsing through files and some of them are for actual analysis and do calculations. I also plan to add my R scripts for certain graphs and calculations in this folder as well.

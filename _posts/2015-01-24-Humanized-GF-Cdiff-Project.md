"Humanized" or human derived microbiomes. I don't care if you hate that word; it's my blog. Updated progress. Original post: 1/24/15


## Current To Do
1) phylum level composition at Day 0 and perhaps some other plot to justify why these samples were selected
2) phylum level changes over time by line plots for the 3 phenotypes, showing individual mice as dashed lines and the mean as a solid line, likely individual graphs for each phylum
	— also plot the OTU-based distances back to Day 0
3) at OTU level what differences are observed between the 3 phenotypes
4) can data from day x in a model predict cdiff on day x+1, so a continuous outcome
	- do Day 0 -> Day 1
5) Can data from day 0 in a model predict 1 of the 3 possible phenotypes: little/no colonization, persistent colonization, colonization + death, so a categorical outcome; using random forest’s feature selection to pick important OTUs in each outcome


## Completed
- get the CFU info in lab
- make the master ids file to be able to sort through the data by different groups
